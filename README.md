# COMP 271 SUMMER 2025 ASSIGNMENT REFLECTIONS

*You may use this file to add reflections about your assignments in the course. The reflections must be substantive. For example, you may find that you missed something in the assignment because you did not put enough time in it or because you did not start work early. It's fine to acknowledge these issues. It is also important to propose a plan to avoid them in the future. And, in later reflections, evaluate how that plan worked. This document is written in a* markup *language called [`MarkDown`](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). It's a fairly simple language that's worth learning.
