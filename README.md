# COMP 271 SUMMER 2025<br/>ASSIGNMENT REFLECTIONS

*You may use this file to add reflections about your assignments in the course. The reflections must be substantive. For example, you may find that you missed something in the assignment because you did not put enough time in it or because you did not start work early. It's fine to acknowledge these issues. It is also important to propose a plan to avoid them in the future. And, in later reflections, evaluate how that plan worked. This document is written in a* markup *language called [`MarkDown`](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). It's a fairly simple language that's worth learning.*

*Created a fork of this repository by clicking the `fork` button on the menu above. Once you have your own repository, go to its settings, all the way to the bottom (in the dangerous zone) and change the visibility to private -- this step is not required but since this is a diary, it may be a good idea to keep it private.*

*For each assignment discuss what you got right, what you got close but not quite, and where you may have missed the mark. Also discuss what you learned by comparing your code to the posted solutions. Beginning with Week 01 assignment, your code must comply with the* [Programmers Pact](./ProgrammersPact.pdf) *in addition to meeting the specifications in the assignment. Use a level-two heading (marked with `##`) for each weekly assignment. The first two headings have been added below for your convenience.*
